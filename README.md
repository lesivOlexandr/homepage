# Homepage

My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé.

## Development

For purpose of viewing resume you can start development server. One way to do it is to npm install `--global serve` and then cd to your working directory and run serve, or you could use [this awesome VScode extension]("https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer") for hotreloading

## Credits

I'd like to say thanks to my mum, that supported me with the tasty food all the time while I was working out this. And [this cool gay]("https://volodymyrkushnir.com/") for css
